# ðŸš€ Ansible + Dockerized Nginx Deployment

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to automate the deployment of a Dockerized Nginx web server using **Ansible**.  
The same Ansible playbook is used to provision both **Dev** and **Prod** environments with minimal manual intervention.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Implement **Infrastructure as Code** principles
- Use Ansible to **install Docker** remotely
- Deploy a **custom HTML landing page** into an Nginx container
- Maintain a single codebase for both Dev and Prod environments

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
Through this project I have:
- Configured **Ansible inventory** for multiple environments
- Automated **Docker installation** and container deployment
- Mounted custom content into containers via **volumes**
- Ensured reproducible deployments across environments
